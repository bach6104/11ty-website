    Reflections from the Moon and Galaxy

    Drifting through a luminescent nebula feels like dancing with the heartbeat of the universe. Clouds of ionized gas glimmer in hues of purple and azure, illuminating my cockpit in surreal color.

    I pause the engine thrusters to let the cosmic dust swirl around me. In the swirling patterns, I see hints of star-birth—swaths of infinite potential waiting to take form. There's a delicate balance here: quiet, yet charged with energy.

    My navigational charts label this region simply as “GN-448,” but I’ve come to call it “the Veil.” Beyond its kaleidoscope of light lies an uncharted sector where few have ventured. Tomorrow, I head further in, uncertain of what I’ll find, yet driven by the profound desire to unravel the galaxy’s secrets.
