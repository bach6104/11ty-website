    My First BLog

    Today marks the start of my quest beyond Earth’s boundaries. From the moment I launched into the cosmic darkness, I’ve been enveloped by a silent tapestry of stars.

    Over the next several months, I’ll be charting undiscovered exoplanets, studying interstellar anomalies, and transmitting logs back to Earth. Each breath of recycled air in the cabin reminds me of our fragile existence—and how small we truly are among the countless galaxies.

    Although my only companion is the soft hum of instruments, I find solace in the starfields that drift past my window. They speak a language of wonder, urging me deeper into the unknown.
